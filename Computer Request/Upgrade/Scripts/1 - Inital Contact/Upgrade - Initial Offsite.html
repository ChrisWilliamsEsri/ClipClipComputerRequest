<p>Hi [Colleague Name], this is [Tech Name] with the IST Deployment team. I am your assigned technician and will be your primary contact for your computer request. Once you have received your machine, please contact me so I may update the system's assets. We will then schedule a one-hour transfer appointment to migrate all your data, settings, and applications to the new machine. Please follow this <a href="https://esri.service-now.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_article=KB0014443">knowledge base article</a> to get a head start on backing up your files to OneDrive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please do not set this device up yourself when it is delivered. A few Server settings may need to be configured before setting up your device. To avoid double work, please reach out when you receive your device so I can assist with the setup. Additionally, you must use your Esri Entra username and Password during the setup. You cannot use other usernames and passwords with your device for security reasons. If you have used any other username and passwords, we may need to reset your device to factory settings and start over.&nbsp;<br><br>We understand you are extremely busy and may be working with team deadlines. We want to work with you and accommodate your schedule. Please let us know if you do not have enough time to complete the steps above, as we have options to postpone your request until a more favorable time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sincerely thank you for your time. Should you have any questions or concerns, please let me know!</p>

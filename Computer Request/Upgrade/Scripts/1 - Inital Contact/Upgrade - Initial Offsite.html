<p>Hi [Colleague Name], this is [Tech Name] with the IST Deployment team. I am your assigned technician and will be your primary contact for your computer request. Once you have received your machine, please contact me so I may update the system's assets. &nbsp;We will then schedule a one-hour transfer appointment to migrate all your data, settings, and applications to the new machine. Please get a head start on backing up your files to OneDrive by following <a href="https://esri.service-now.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_article=KB0014443">this knowledge base article</a>.</p><p>Please do not set this device up yourself when it is delivered. A few Server settings may need to be configured before setting up your device. To avoid double work, please reach out when you receive your device so I can assist with the setup. Additionally, you must use your Esri Entra username and Password during the setup. You cannot use other usernames and passwords with your device for security reasons. If you have used any other username and password in your current device, we may need to reset your device to factory settings and start over.&nbsp;<br><br>This computer request can take a few weeks to complete from beginning to end, as well as several hours of your time. We understand that you are extremely busy and may be working with team deadlines. We want to work with you and accommodate your schedule. If you feel you do not have enough time to complete the steps above, please let us know so we can either postpone your upgrade or cancel it until a later date.<br><br>If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hello [Name], This is [YourName] with the IST Deployment

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to set a time for a one on one with you so that
we can make sure everything is working and you are able to access some of the
important websites you will use during your time here. Please take a look at
your calendar and let me know when you are available for a quick meeting via
Teams; it should only take about 30 minutes.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[[ONSITE ONLY]] Your computer is currently secured with a
cable lock at your desk. If you need to unlock it, the password for the cable
lock is [LockPassword], which is arranged from top to bottom. Additionally, you
should find a wrapper with this password located underneath your computer
charger in one of your file cabinet drawers. We suggest relocating that sticker
to a secure place to keep it out of sight from others as soon as possible.
Please keep your device locked when you are not around. <i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
